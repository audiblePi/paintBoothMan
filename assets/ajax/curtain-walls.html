	<p>Curtain walls can serve a variety of uses in the industrial, commercial and automotive industries where several different tasks are being preformed in a single work space.  They provide an economical alternative to permanent walls providing space separation, privacy, climate control, protection from dust, dirt, paint, overspray or sparks. The curtains are hung on tracks that allow them to slide out of the way when not needed.

The standard curtains have a white vinyl top, a clear plastic window center and a blue vinyl bottom.  Most curtains install easily with no need for special tools.</p>
