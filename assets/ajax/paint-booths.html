	<p>Paint Booth Maintenance Service has been in the paint booth business for over 15 years. We are an authorized distributor of Colmet & Accudraft spray piant booths. All of our products offer a combination of high quality and great value with special attention to customer service.</p>
	<p>Our large paint booth selection includes open front, crossdraft, semi-downdraft, side downdraft and downdraft spray booths, prep stations and paint mixing rooms.  All our booths come with full manufacture warranty. Our booths provide a safe, clean environment that will comply with all OSHA & NFPA standards.</p>
	<p>Choosing the right booth is essential to your shop productivity and a high quality finished product.  In a Crossdraft booth the fresh air is brought in the booth through intake filters located in the doors at the front of the booth. The clean filtered air then travels horizontally to rear exhaust filters. A crossdraft booth is economical to purchase, operate and maintain.</p>
	<p>A Semi Downdraft booth allows filtered air to enter the booth through the rear ceiling. The air moves vertically and horizontally and exits through exhaust filters in the rear wall of the booth.</p>
	<p>Side Downdraft or Modified Down Draft spray booths allows for airflow to enter the booth from a pre-filtered intake plenum in the ceiling and down through a 2nd set of high quality diffusion media filters. The air flows vertically and exits the exhaust plenum in either the back wall or the lower interior sides of the booth. This provides efficient overspray control and a healthier, cleaner work environment without an expensive downdraft exhaust pit.</p>
	<p>The Down Draft booth provides vertical down draft airflow. The air enters the booth from a pre-filtered intake plenum in the ceiling and down through a 2nd set of high quality diffusion media filters. The filtered air moves tightly around the vehicle and exits the booth through the exhaust filters in the floor. The exhaust filters in the downdraft booth are in a pit below the ground or in an above ground basement that sits on the existing floor. This booth provides the cleanest intake air, most efficient overspray control and the highest quality finished product.</p>
	<p>*All models of spray paint booths have the option to be pressurized and or heated. A cure cycle with or without recirculation can also be added.</p>
	<p>A Previously Owned spray paint booth can be an excellent option with a greatly reduced price tag. We regularly acquire previously owned booths in good working condition. Our inventory is constantly changing so check our site regularly to find the booth that fits your needs.</p>
	<p>There are many factors to consider when purchasing a spray paint booth. How much space do you have? How much and what type of duct will you need? Does your booth need heat? Will you install your booth or do you need professional installation? Don't forget a fire suppression system and electrical work will be needed. Our paint booth experts can help you answer any questions and provide you with your best options at our best price.</p>
