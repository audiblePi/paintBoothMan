	<h4>HOW TO DETERMINE THE CORRECT FILTERS FOR YOUR PAINT BOOTH</h4>
	<p>To find the filters you are looking for on the PBMS website you can either look them up by type & size or by booth manufacturer.</p>
	<p>If you know the manufacturer of your paint booth select the by booth manufacturer category. After you select your specific manufacturer & model of booth you will see a selection of possible filter sizes recommended for that booth. From this selection, choose the filters you need for your booth. Please check your booth, measure your existing filter sizes and quantity. Confirm that the quantity & sizes match what you have chosen for your booth.</p>
	<p>If you are unsure of the size and number of filters your booth requires you will need to measure & count the filters you are currently using or measure & count the openings where the filters should be. Be careful when taking these measurements. The filters must cover the entire opening. If you do not see the size you are looking for in our selection, you have most likely measured incorrectly. That being said, there are some unique paint booths which may require custom sized filters. If you are in this situation we will create a custom order for you.</p>
